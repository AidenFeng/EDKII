/**
  The ExtractSection() function processes the input section and
  returns a pointer to the section contents. If the section being
  extracted does not require processing (if the section
  GuidedSectionHeader.Attributes has the
  EFI_GUIDED_SECTION_PROCESSING_REQUIRED field cleared), then
  OutputBuffer is just updated to point to the start of the
  section's contents. Otherwise, *Buffer must be allocated
  from PEI permanent memory.

  @param This                   Indicates the
                                EFI_PEI_GUIDED_SECTION_EXTRACTION_PPI instance.
                                Buffer containing the input GUIDed section to be
                                processed. OutputBuffer OutputBuffer is
                                allocated from PEI permanent memory and contains
                                the new section stream.
  @param InputSection           A pointer to the input buffer, which contains
                                the input section to be processed.
  @param OutputBuffer           A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer, whose
                                size is specified by the contents of OutputSize.
  @param OutputSize             A pointer to a caller-allocated

                                allocation is stored. If the function
                                returns anything other than EFI_SUCCESS,
                                the value of OutputSize is undefined.
  @param AuthenticationStatus   A pointer to a caller-allocated
                                UINT32 that indicates the
                                authentication status of the
                                output buffer. If the input
                                section's GuidedSectionHeader.

                                EFI_GUIDED_SECTION_AUTH_STATUS_VALID 
                                bit as clear,
                                AuthenticationStatus must return
                                zero. These bits reflect the
                                status of the extraction
                                operation. If the function

                                EFI_SUCCESS, the value of

                                successfully processed and the
